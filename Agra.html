        <h2>About Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum located on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
            <br> tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare complex that includes a mosque and a guest house and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall1. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, <br>but
            work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.<br> The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million1. The Taj Mahal was designated
            as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage"2. <br>It attracts more than 6 million visitors a year1.</p>
